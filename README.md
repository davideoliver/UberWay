The Smart Mobility Improver For Any City - UberHackathon 2023 Case

Our project aims to develop a program that can solve the transportation issues of the fictional city of Uberland. We plan to use artificial intelligence and intelligent algorithms to find the best mobility solutions. 

To start, we virtually simulated a city and its streets by creating a graph that represents the city. From there, we implemented our ideas on how to improve accessibility and reduce traffic congestion by finding the shortest routes.
